## Overview

The Jerrix Polymarket Copy Trading Bot automatically replicates trades from successful Polymarket traders to your wallet. It monitors trader activity 24/7, calculates proportional position sizes based on your capital, and executes matching orders in real-time. Following successful traders like **gabagool22** has been proven to work with this bot.

### How It Works

1. **Select Traders** - Choose top performers from [Polymarket leaderboard](https://polymarket.com/leaderboard) or [Predictfolio](https://predictfolio.com) (e.g. gabagool22)
2. **Monitor Activity** - Bot continuously watches for new positions opened by selected traders using Polymarket Data API
3. **Calculate Size** - Automatically scales trades based on your balance vs. trader's balance
4. **Execute Orders** - Places matching orders on Polymarket using your wallet
5. **Track Performance** - Maintains complete trade history in MongoDB

## Safety & Risk Management

⚠️ **Important Disclaimers:**

- **Use at your own risk** - This bot executes real trades with real money
- **Start small** - Test with minimal funds before scaling up
- **Diversify** - Don't copy only one trader; track multiple strategies
- **Monitor regularly** - Check bot logs daily to ensure proper execution
- **No guarantees** - Past performance doesn't guarantee future results

### Best Practices

1. Use a dedicated wallet separate from your main funds
2. Only allocate capital you can afford to lose
3. Research traders thoroughly before copying
4. Set up monitoring and alerts
5. Know how to stop the bot quickly (Ctrl+C)
